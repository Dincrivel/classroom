Hello, I'm **Diego Velasques**!
Currently, I work in a different field, but I’m actively sharpening my skills to transition into software development—a dynamic and ever-evolving industry that thrives on innovation and problem-solving. Every day, I’m learning something new to turn this passion into my career. *I’ve set a personal deadline to make this career shift by April 2024, and every day, I’m pushing myself to turn this goal into reality.*
