            <h2>What is Gacha?</h2>
            <p>Gacha games take their name from <strong>"gachapon"</strong>, Japanese capsule-toy vending machines that
                dispense random
                collectible toys.<sup>1</sup> The term combines "gacha" (the crank sound) and "pon" (the toy dropping).
                These
                machines became wildly popular in Japan starting in the 1960s, creating a culture of collecting
                randomized figures, stickers, and trinkets. This concept later inspired digital adaptations in video
                games.</p>

            <p>The first major gacha-style game mechanic appeared in 2010 with <strong>Dragon
                    Collection</strong>(Konami), a social
                card game that introduced randomized digital pulls.<sup>2</sup> However, the genre exploded in 2013 with
                <strong>Puzzle & Dragons</strong> (GungHo) and <strong>Granblue Fantasy</strong> (Cygames), which
                refined the
                formula: players "rolled" for
                characters using premium currency, with rare units driving engagement. These games laid the foundation
                for modern gacha systems.

            <h2>History of Gacha Games</h2>
            <p>Gachapon (<mark>ガチャポン</mark>), named after the "gacha" (crank) sound and "pon" (capsule drop), were
                physical vending
                machines in Japan that dispensed random toys in sealed capsules. For a small fee (usually 100–500 yen),
                players would turn a knob and receive a mystery item, often part of a themed collection (anime figures,
                keychains, etc.). The thrill of randomness and the desire to collect rare items made them hugely
                popular.</p>

            <p>This mechanic was adapted into digital games in the early 2010s, replacing physical toys with virtual
                characters or items. The first major gacha game, Dragon Collection (2010), used card-collecting
                mechanics, while Puzzle & Dragons (2012) combined gacha with match-3 gameplay. Developers realized that
                randomized rewards—especially with tiered rarity systems (e.g., SSR, SR, R)—encouraged repeated
                spending, much like gambling. The success of games like Fate/Grand Order (2015) and Genshin Impact
                (2020) proved the model’s profitability, leading to its global spread. However, unlike physical
                gachapon, digital gacha lacks tangible value, raising ethical concerns over addiction and exploitative
                monetization.</p>

            <h2>How this is?</h2>
            <p>Gacha games encourage players to spend copious amounts of in-game currency to get items. Players obtain
                the
                in-game currency by playing or buying it using actual money.</p>

            <p>According to Qustodio, Gacha games first grew in popularity in the 2010s, originally named “Gashapon” or
                “Gachapon,” which was a type of toy vending machine popular in shopping malls, arcades, and convenience
                stores across the country.</p>

            <p>Eventually, the name was shortened to “<abbr title="Gachapon">Gacha</abbr>”, and now, this form of gaming is one of the top forms in
                the
                world.</p>

            <p><q>Spending money on games isn’t a problem, but it becomes one when players spend hundreds or even
                    thousands
                    trying to get one singular in-game item. According to Sensor Tower’s list of the top-grossing games
                    of 2021,
                    Genshin Impact, a popular Gacha game that rose in popularity during that year, generated about
                    $153.4
                    million, and 33% of that money came from players spending money within the game.</q><sup>3</sup></p>
